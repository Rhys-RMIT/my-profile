    <p><strong>Basic Information:</strong> I currently live in Brooklyn NYC and
      have lived here for the past eight years. I am a dual Australian and US
      citizen and have spent a lot of my younger years travelling the world and
      exploring. Some languages I speak and read are a little French and
      understanding of some Italian. I have completed high school and over the
      years completed several online courses that universities run on Edx.org.
      My favorite past time is to travel. I love culture, history and visiting
      interesting places.
    </div>
    </p>
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <div id="paragraph-detail">
    <p>My interest in IT has stemmed from an early age. I have always been
      interested in technology and electronics. When I was in high school, I was
      able to gain work experience at a university within their television
      studio and media center. This was during a time when television and media
      was converging with computers. And that is how I became interested in
      information technology.  </p>
    <p>For years I thought I would never be good enough to study IT or go to
      university. I thought that university would be something I would never be
      able to do. After many years and exploring the world backpacking and
      tinkering with electronics and software I ended up in NYC where an
      employer gave me the opportunity to work within their IT department.
      Since then, my interest has grown in IT, however there was many gaps in my
      knowledge and the industry changes so rapidly I decided to take the chance
      and study IT. </p>
    <p>I chose to enroll with RMIT because it has a good reputation in IT and I
      believe that RMIT is an excellent school for the foundation of my
      undergraduate education. It's quite possible that if I can, I would like
      to also continue my education if I am successful in completing this
      degree</p>

      <p><strong>A description of the position, and particularly what makes this
       position appealing to me:</strong></p><br>
    <div id="paragraph-detail">
      <p>The Cybersecurity Senior Business Analyst is a position that I would
        eventually like to achieve and be a part of the Cybersecurity team who
        provides in depth support and knowledge to the ASX. This type of
        position is ideal for me as I am interested in continuing my studies
        after my bachelor's degree within economics. The Cybersecurity Senior
        Business Analyst will be tightening and implementing cybersecurity
        measures, work closely with Cybersecurity Architects, Threat Analysis'
        and Tech Writers across projects, performing traditional Business
        Analyst requirements - e.g., Running workshops, creating user stories,
        documenting user requirements, process mapping, managing
        internal/external stakeholders. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="paragraph-detail">
      <p><strong>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience
       required for the position:</strong></p><br>
       <p>Skills required are to run penetration tests, use ethical hacking
         standards, test software vulnerabilities, monitor networks for unusual
         activity, respond to alerts on a 24/7 basis, work with technical
         writers to implement documentation and report this to your senior
         director or leadership on an immediate basis on emergencies and daily
         basis through reporting and documentation updates. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="paragraph-detail">
      <p><strong>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience I
       currently have:</strong></p><br>
       <p>Current skills I have are several years' experience in a Level III
         desktop support analyst role in a hybrid network environment where
         hybrid means that the network is based on a classic network and cloud
         is based on a cloud network. I am also a part of a cybersecurity
         committee at my place of employment where we were discussing and
         developing the procedures and strategies for a cybersecurity team.
         I have also completed some courses in programming Arduino projects
         and some C basic programming. And have completed the CompTia A+ CE
         certification. </p><br>
     </div>
      <p><strong>My plan on how I will obtain the skills, qualifications and
        experience required for the position:</strong></p><br>
        <p>My current employment is providing me with some great real-world
          experience in the Information Technology industry, and I plan to
          continue with this while I study for my bachelor's degree in IT. I
          lack a degree in IT, and although some employers do not require this
          as a prerequisite, I personally believe that to get involved in the
          more challenging and innovative aspects of a business's technology
          department, a degree will help me prove to employers that I have the
          understanding, skills, and qualifications to meet their confidence
          and abilities to lead their business at the pinnacle of technology. </p>

    <p>These tests can be used as an indicator to understand my personality

      type of person I am. However, they may not be one-hundred percent accurate
      of me.</p>

    <p>These tests may be able to show you where my potentials are within a team.
       For example, I do like to listen to others and present my own ideas. I am
       always thinking of an alternative way within reason.</p>

    <p>When another person in a team gives me their ideas and both of our ideas
       conflict, I like to discuss the reasons how and why they conflict and if
       there is a way where we can create a hybrid idea together. Sometimes when
       in a team we decide to do the opposite of what another suggests because
       we either do not want to do what the other wishes or we simply want to
       instill our own ideas. I am the type of person who will always agree with
       others when my own ideas are proven inefficient or there is a better
       method. I am not afraid to agree when I am wrong.</p>
  </div>
<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
  <div id="paragraph-detail">
    <p><strong>The Smart Garden</strong></p><br>
    <p>Since I like nature and wellbeing, I have been interested in creating a
       smart garden. This smart garden should be able to be controlled by an app
       through a mobile device. The smart garden would be about twice the size
       of a refrigerator and could potentially be the next generation whitegoods
       product for millions of homes around the world and help to reduce hunger
       and starvation.</p>

    <p>To introduce this as a standard in our homes we would need to work with
       architects to develop spaces within common home plans so that these can
       be purchased and placed in a relevant area of the home.</p>

    <p>The Smart Garden can also be placed indoors or outdoors with two
       different models.</p>

    <p>The indoor model would be much like a refrigerator and include
      transparent glass windows so that the owner can easily see inside the
      smart garden. It would be aesthetically designed and pleasing to
      customers. The indoor model would also include internal blinds to reduce
      light from the hydroponic lamp system if the lights were on at night or
      the user does not want to see the plants.</p>

    <p>The outdoor model would be more have an outdoor furniture design yet be
       durable enough to handle all weather conditions. Windows would
       automatically open when needed for fresh air in the summer and closed to
       create a greenhouse during the winter. The outdoor option also helps
       against rodents and other animals eating the plants.</p>

    <p>Owners may wish to buy several of the indoor and outdoor smart gardens,
       and they can be linked together as desired.</p>

    <p>How the Smart Garden works, would be connected to the home water and
       electrical system. A program would be developed to check the plants,
       fruit and vegetables being grown. Regulate temperatures, control water
       flow and lighting for optimal growth. We would develop an online website
       and an app that could control the smart garden remotely through Arduino
       hardware and sensors, actuators, motors, and cameras for optimal plant
       growth.</p>

    <p>There are some of these already existing in the market today, however the
       problem I find with these others are they are not sustainable. For
       example, the smart garden should be able to grow and produce enough green
       food for a small family in an average family home space.</p>

 <div id="paragraph-detail">
    <p><strong>Flight Navigation System (FNS)</strong></p><br>
    <p>The Flight Navigation System (FNS) is a system designed for the future of
       traffic. In the not-too-distant future, the world will need a way to
       reduce traffic and that will occur through flight. The average consumer
       will be able to fly from his or her home to their chosen destination.
       The question is how will this be regulated and how will we develop the
       technology to enhance this experience?</p>

    <p>The flight navigation system is an operating system that is connected to
       the vehicles computer and will control the navigation to a destination.
       The driver or pilot will control the vehicle using the control column or
       better known by gamers as a joystick to control the direction of the
       vehicle. The vehicle will not fly unless the pilot is also wearing a
       connected helmet. And the helmet will act as an augmented reality device
       where the pilot can visually see the road in front of the vehicle with
       augmented overlays producing flight paths and rules like road rules.</p>

    <p>For example, some of the flight rules would need to be developed to
      create this technology and how it would be used effectively. A rule such
      as: How high above ground traffic should a flying vehicle be allowed to
      fly? Would be programmed into the FNS so that a pilot cannot fly too high
      and enter airplane airspace or too low where the vehicle may collide with
      a telegraph pole, trees, or building.</p>

    <p>Another questionable rule would be: Should the flying vehicle be able to
       fly over existing road infrastructure? Since the roads are already
       mapped, they could keep the aircraft traffic in order effectively
       creating a second layer of traffic above ground traffic.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="paragraph-detail">
    <p><strong>Flying Cars and Motorcycles</strong></p><br>
    <p>If we were to create new ways to transport humans, then we are going to
        need to look to the sky. The land is already congested around cities and
        towns. And that is why electric flying cars and motorcycles are going
        to be the next important thing for transportation. Especially when
        humans start to settle on Mars.<br><br>

        Developing a flying car or motorcycle would be an exciting project. A
        lot of the hardware such as flight controllers, electric motors and
        computer hardware technology have already been developed and can be
        implemented with good software development and design.<br><br>

        The flying car and motorcycle concept would need many sensors added to
        the vehicle. For the operating system to compute.  Some of the sensors
        would need to be an ultrasonic or an infrared sensor to measure distance
        between objects and used to protect pilots against collisions. Another
        sensor would be a barometric pressure sensor to detect the altitude of
        a vehicle so that when the sensor detects that a pilot is flying too
        low or too high the vehicle safety system can automatically correct the
        error. Furthermore, a lidar system uses lasers to measure distances and
        are used in scanning the surrounding space to create a three-dimensional
        view for the computer to calculate difficult to see obstacles such as
        wires or birds.<br><br>

        The sensors would be controlled by good software programming such as
        the development of the Flight Navigation System (FNS) mentioned above
        for a mixture of automated tasks and pilot interaction. Human beings
        would need to have some form of control of the vehicle during takeoff
        and landing until a fully automated system can be trusted by the
        population.<br><br>

        This type of project would be most useful for when humans begin to live
        on mars. Mars is a smaller planet (slightly more than half the size of
        the earth) The surface gravity on Mars is less than the surface gravity
        on Earth. The surface gravity on Mars is only about 38% of the surface
        gravity on Earth, so if a vehicle weighed 1 ton on Earth, the vehicle
        would weigh about 380 kilograms on Mars. And this is why flying vehicles
        would be ideal on Mars.</p><br><br>
